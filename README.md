BDFL: A 100% Accurate Depiciton of OSS Maintenance
==================================================

This is a clicker game that simulates creating an open source project
in Git, and taking contributions.

Go to [the github.io page to play right now](https://derrickstolee.github.io/bdfl).

Rules?
------

You want to release as much as possible! However, it takes more commits to justify
each release.

However, releases help attract new contributors! They'll get better at making commits
as you merge their contributions!

How do you win?
---------------

Like many things in life, you cannot win this game. You can just eventually be
overwhelmed by the work required to keep up with the demands of your community
until you give up.

Are you serious?
----------------

This is not a serious game, but really an excuse to create fun commit graphs.
